# 1. Define the pandas DataFrame representing car sales
# The data dictionary contains information about various cars.
data = {
    "CarID": ["C001", "C002", "C003", "C004", "C005", "C006"],
    "Brand": ["Toyota", "Honda", "Ford", "Toyota", "BMW", "Honda"],
    "Model": ["Camry", "Civic", "Focus", "Rav4", "X5", "Accord"],
    "Year": [2020, 2021, 2019, 2022, 2023, 2020],
    "PriceUSD": [25000, 22000, 18000, 30000, 60000, 24000],
    "Mileage": [30000, 20000, 45000, 15000, 5000, 35000]

# Create the DataFrame from the dictionary
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Print the original DataFrame to verify its creation (optional)
# print("Original DataFrame:")
# print(df)
# print("-" * 30)

# 2. Filter the DataFrame to include only cars of the "Toyota" brand.
# We use boolean indexing to select rows where the 'Brand' column is 'Toyota'.
toyota_cars_df = df[df['Brand'] == 'Toyota']

# Print the filtered DataFrame to verify (optional)
# print("Toyota Cars DataFrame:")
# print(toyota_cars_df)
# print("-" * 30)

# 3. For these Toyota cars, calculate and print the average "Mileage".
# We select the 'Mileage' column from the filtered DataFrame and then apply the .mean() method.
# Handle edge case: If no Toyota cars are found, the mean might be NaN.
# In this specific dataset, Toyota cars are present, so this is not an issue.
# However, for robustness, one might check if toyota_cars_df is empty before calculating.
if not toyota_cars_df.empty:
    average_mileage_toyota = toyota_cars_df['Mileage'].mean()

    # Print the calculated average mileage
    print(f"The average Mileage for Toyota cars is: {average_mileage_toyota:.2f}")

    print("No Toyota cars found in the DataFrame to calculate average mileage.")
