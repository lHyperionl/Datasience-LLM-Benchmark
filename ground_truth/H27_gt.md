import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

# --- 1. Load the dataset ---
# Assume 'iris.csv' is in the current directory
try:
    df = pd.read_csv('iris.csv')
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: 'iris.csv' not found. Please ensure the file is in the current directory.")
    exit() # Exit if the file is not found

# --- 2. Create two new features ---
# Calculate PetalArea as PetalLengthCm * PetalWidthCm
df['PetalArea'] = df['PetalLengthCm'] * df['PetalWidthCm']
# Calculate SepalArea as SepalLengthCm * SepalWidthCm
df['SepalArea'] = df['SepalLengthCm'] * df['SepalWidthCm']

# --- 3. Define features X and target y ---
# Define the list of features to be used for X
# This includes the original four numerical features and the two newly created features
feature_columns = [
    'SepalLengthCm', 'SepalWidthCm', 'PetalLengthCm', 'PetalWidthCm',
    'PetalArea', 'SepalArea'

X = df[feature_columns]

# Define the target variable y
y = df['Species']

# --- 4. Encode the target variable ---
# Initialize LabelEncoder to convert species names into numerical labels
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
# Fit and transform the 'Species' column
y_encoded = label_encoder.fit_transform(y)

# --- 5. Train a Gradient Boosting Classifier ---
# Initialize the GradientBoostingClassifier with specified parameters
# n_estimators=100: Number of boosting stages to perform.
# random_state=42: Ensures reproducibility of the results.
gb_classifier = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# --- 6. Perform 5-fold cross-validation ---
# Use cross_val_score to evaluate the model's performance
# cv=5: Specifies 5-fold cross-validation
# scoring='accuracy': Specifies that accuracy should be used as the evaluation metric
cv_scores = cross_val_score(gb_classifier, X, y_encoded, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')

# --- 7. Report the mean cross-validated accuracy score ---
# Calculate the mean of the cross-validation scores
mean_accuracy = cv_scores.mean()
print(f"Cross-validation accuracy scores for each fold: {cv_scores}")
