import pandas as pd

# Define the DataFrame as specified in the task
# This dictionary holds the data for our book inventory.
data = {
    "BookID": ["B001", "B002", "B003", "B004", "B005"],
    "Title": ["The Great Gatsby", "To Kill a Mockingbird", "1984", "Pride and Prejudice", "The Hobbit"],
    "Author": ["F. Scott Fitzgerald", "Harper Lee", "George Orwell", "Jane Austen", "J.R.R. Tolkien"],
    "Genre": ["Classic", "Classic", "Dystopian", "Romance", "Fantasy"],
    "Stock": [12, 8, 15, 7, 20],
    "Price": [10.99, 9.50, 12.00, 8.75, 15.25]
}

# Create the pandas DataFrame from the data dictionary
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# --- Task 1: Print the "Title" of the book with the highest "Price" ---

# Find the index of the row with the maximum 'Price'.
# idxmax() returns the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value.
idx_max_price = df['Price'].idxmax()

# Use the obtained index to get the 'Title' from that specific row.
# .loc[] is used for label-based indexing.
title_highest_price = df.loc[idx_max_price, 'Title']

# Print the result for the book with the highest price.
print(f"The title of the book with the highest price is: '{title_highest_price}'")

# --- Task 2: Print the total number of books currently in "Stock" ---

# Calculate the sum of all values in the 'Stock' column.
# This gives the total count of all books across all titles.
total_stock = df['Stock'].sum()

# Print the total number of books in stock.
print(f"The total number of books currently in stock is: {total_stock}")

# --- Edge Case Consideration (for robustness, though not strictly needed for this specific dataset) ---
# If the DataFrame could be empty, idxmax() would raise a ValueError.
# A robust solution might include a check:
# if not df.empty:
#     idx_max_price = df['Price'].idxmax()
#     title_highest_price = df.loc[idx_max_price, 'Title']
#     print(f"The title of the book with the highest price is: '{title_highest_price}'")
#     total_stock = df['Stock'].sum()
#     print(f"The total number of books currently in stock is: {total_stock}")
# else:
#     print("The inventory DataFrame is empty.")
