# Define the data for the DataFrame

    "Brand": ["Toyota", "Honda", "Ford", "Toyota", "BMW", "Honda"],
    "Model": ["Camry", "Civic", "Focus", "Rav4", "X5", "Accord"],
    "Year": [2020, 2021, 2019, 2022, 2023, 2020],
    "PriceUSD": [25000, 22000, 18000, 30000, 60000, 24000],
    "Mileage": [30000, 20000, 45000, 15000, 5000, 35000]
}

# Create the pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# --- Data Analysis ---

# 1) Calculate and print the total number of cars in the dataset
# The total number of cars is simply the number of rows in the DataFrame.
# df.shape[0] returns the number of rows.
total_cars = df.shape[0]
print(f"Total number of cars in the dataset: {total_cars}")

# 2) Calculate and print the average "PriceUSD" of all cars
# The .mean() method on a Series calculates the average of its values.
average_price_usd = df["PriceUSD"].mean()
# Using an f-string to format the output to two decimal places for currency.
print(f"Average PriceUSD of all cars: ${average_price_usd:.2f}")

# Optional: Display the DataFrame to verify its creation (for debugging/verification)
# print("\nDataFrame created:")
# print(df)
