```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Define the path to the dataset
file_path = 'winequality-red.csv'

# --- Step 1: Load the dataset ---
try:
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The file '{file_path}' was not found.")
    print("Please ensure 'winequality-red.csv' is in the same directory as the script.")
    exit() # Exit the script if the file is not found

# --- Step 2: Calculate and report the average (mean) 'quality' of the red wines ---
average_quality = df['quality'].mean()
print(f"1. Average 'quality' of red wines: {average_quality:.2f}\n")

# --- Step 3: Group the wines by their 'quality' score and calculate the average 'alcohol' content for each quality group ---
# Group by 'quality' and calculate the mean of 'alcohol' for each group
# .reset_index() converts the grouped Series back into a DataFrame for easier plotting
average_alcohol_by_quality = df.groupby('quality')['alcohol'].mean().reset_index()

print("2. Average 'alcohol' content for each 'quality' group:")
print(average_alcohol_by_quality)
print("\n")

# --- Step 4: Create a bar chart visualizing the relationship between 'quality' and average 'alcohol' content ---

# Set a style for the plots for better aesthetics
sns.set_style("whitegrid")

# Create the bar chart using seaborn
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) # Set the figure size for better readability
sns.barplot(x='quality', y='alcohol', data=average_alcohol_by_quality, palette='viridis')

# Add titles and labels for clarity
plt.title('Average Alcohol Content by Wine Quality', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Quality Score', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Average Alcohol Content (%)', fontsize=12)
plt.xticks(fontsize=10)
plt.yticks(fontsize=10)

# Add data labels on top of the bars for precise values
for index, row in average_alcohol_by_quality.iterrows():
    plt.text(index, row['alcohol'], f'{row["alcohol"]:.2f}',
             color='black', ha="center", va='bottom', fontsize=9)

# Adjust layout to prevent labels from overlapping
plt.tight_layout()

# Display the plot
plt.show()
