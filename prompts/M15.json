  "prompt": "Write Python code to perform advanced feature engineering and dimensionality reduction on the diabetes.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Load and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values), 2) Create engineered features: 'Metabolic_Score' (combination of Glucose, BMI, and Insulin), 'Risk_Factor_Count' (count of high-risk factors), 'Glucose_per_Age', 'BMI_BloodPressure_interaction', 'Pedigree_Age_product', 3) Apply polynomial features (degree 2) to selected numerical columns, 4) Perform feature scaling using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler, 5) Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and explain variance ratios, 6) Use SelectKBest and Recursive Feature Elimination for feature selection, 7) Implement correlation-based feature filtering to remove highly correlated features (threshold > 0.9), 8) Apply SMOTE for handling class imbalance, 9) Evaluate feature importance using Random Forest and visualize top features. Include proper imports and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
