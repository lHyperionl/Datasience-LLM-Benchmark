  "prompt": "Write Python code to load the spotify_2023.csv dataset using pandas. The code should: 1) Clean the `in_shazam_charts` column by removing any commas and then converting it to a numeric data type (coerce errors to NaN and report count of NaNs). 2) Group the data by `key` and `mode`. 3) For each combination of `key` and `mode`, calculate and display the average `danceability_%` and average `valence_%`. Include proper imports and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
