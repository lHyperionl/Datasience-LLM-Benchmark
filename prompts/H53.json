The code should: 1) Create a new numerical feature \"DeviceType_Numeric\" by mapping \"Desktop\" to 0 and \"Mobile\" to 1. 2) Create another new feature \"PagesPerMinute\" calculated as \"PagesViewed\" / \"SessionDurationMinutes\". Handle any potential division by zero by replacing resulting NaNs or Infs with 0. 3) Select \"SessionDurationMinutes\", \"PagesViewed\", \"DeviceType_Numeric\", and \"PagesPerMinute\" as the feature set. 4) Print the head of this new feature DataFrame. Provide only Python code.",
