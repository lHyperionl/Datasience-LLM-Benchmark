  "prompt": "Write Python code to load the iris.csv dataset and perform an independent two-sample t-test. The code should: 1) Load the dataset. 2) Filter the data to get two groups: `Species` == 'Iris-versicolor' and `Species` == 'Iris-virginica'. 3) Perform an independent two-sample t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the mean `PetalLengthCm` between these two species groups. 4) Clearly state the null and alternative hypotheses for this test. 5) Print the calculated t-statistic and the p-value. 6) Based on a significance level of alpha = 0.05, interpret the p-value and state whether to reject the null hypothesis. Include proper imports (pandas, scipy.stats) and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
