  "prompt": "Write Python code for advanced statistical modeling to assess the impact of 'stringency_index' and 'people_fully_vaccinated' (as a percentage of population) on the 'reproduction_rate', considering 'location' and 'continent' effects, using synthetic_covid19_data.csv. The code should: 1) Load data, parse 'date'. Calculate 'vaccination_percentage' = 'people_fully_vaccinated' / 'population'. 2) Handle missing values in 'reproduction_rate', 'stringency_index', and 'vaccination_percentage' (e.g., interpolation or median imputation grouped by location). 3) Implement a mixed-effects linear regression model. 'reproduction_rate' is the dependent variable. Fixed effects: 'stringency_index', 'vaccination_percentage', and their interaction. Random effects: random intercepts for 'location' nested within 'continent'. 4) Fit the model using statsmodels. 5) Report the fixed effects coefficients, their standard errors, and p-values. Interpret the significance and direction of these effects. 6) Report the variance components for the random effects. 7) Discuss model assumptions (linearity, normality of residuals, homoscedasticity) and briefly describe how they could be checked (plotting residuals, Q-Q plots, etc. - no need to implement checks). Include proper imports. Provide only Python code.",
