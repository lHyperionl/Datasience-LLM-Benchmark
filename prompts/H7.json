  "prompt": "Write Python code to build an advanced ensemble learning and model optimization system for water potability prediction on the water_potability.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Implement comprehensive data preprocessing with multiple imputation strategies, outlier detection and treatment, and advanced feature engineering including polynomial and interaction features, 2) Build and optimize multiple base models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Neural Network, SVM) using GridSearchCV or Bayesian optimization, 3) Create ensemble models using stacking, voting, and blending techniques, 4) Implement advanced evaluation with stratified k-fold cross-validation, learning curves, validation curves, and bootstrap sampling, 5) Apply SHAP or LIME for model interpretability and feature importance analysis, 6) Perform statistical significance testing between models using paired t-tests, 7) Create comprehensive model comparison dashboard with performance metrics, feature importance, and prediction confidence intervals, 8) Implement model calibration and probability calibration plots. Include proper imports (pandas, sklearn, xgboost, shap, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy) and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
