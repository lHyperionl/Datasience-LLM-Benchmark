  "prompt": "Write Python code to load the spotify_2023.csv dataset using pandas. The code should: 1) Generate a histogram to visualize the distribution of the `bpm` column. 2) Create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between `danceability_%` (x-axis) and `energy_%` (y-axis). 3) Ensure both plots have titles and labeled axes. Include proper imports (pandas, matplotlib.pyplot) and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
