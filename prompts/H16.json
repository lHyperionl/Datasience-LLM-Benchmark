  "prompt": "Write Python code to implement advanced machine learning ensemble methods for happiness prediction using the world-happiness-report-2021.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Load and comprehensively preprocess the dataset with advanced feature engineering, 2) Implement multiple ensemble methods: Voting Regressor (hard and soft voting), Bagging with different base estimators, Boosting algorithms (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), 3) Create stacking ensemble with multiple base learners and meta-learner, 4) Implement Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning using Optuna or Hyperopt, 5) Use nested cross-validation for robust model evaluation, 6) Implement custom ensemble with dynamic weight assignment based on model performance, 7) Apply advanced techniques like blending and multi-level stacking, 8) Perform comprehensive model interpretation using SHAP values and LIME, 9) Implement model calibration and uncertainty quantification, 10) Create ensemble diversity analysis and model combination optimization. Include proper imports and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
