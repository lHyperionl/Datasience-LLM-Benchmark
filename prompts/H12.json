  "prompt": "Write Python code to perform advanced clustering and market segmentation analysis on the video_games_sales.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Load and preprocess the dataset, creating features like 'Regional_Sales_Distribution' (proportion of sales across regions), 'Market_Position' (rank within genre), and 'Publisher_Portfolio_Size', 2) Implement multiple clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models, 3) Use advanced techniques like t-SNE and UMAP for dimensionality reduction and visualization, 4) Determine optimal number of clusters using silhouette analysis, elbow method, and gap statistic, 5) Perform consensus clustering to identify stable clusters across different algorithms, 6) Create detailed cluster profiles with statistical significance testing, 7) Implement anomaly detection to identify unusual games or market patterns, 8) Use association rule mining to find patterns between game attributes, 9) Build a recommendation system based on clustering results, 10) Validate clustering results using internal and external validation metrics. Include proper imports and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
