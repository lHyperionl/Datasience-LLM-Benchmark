  "prompt": "Write Python code to load the iris.csv dataset, train three different classification models, and compare their performance. The code should: 1) Load the dataset. 2) Define features `X` using `SepalLengthCm`, `SepalWidthCm`, `PetalLengthCm`, `PetalWidthCm`, and target `y` using `Species`. 3) Encode the `Species` target variable. 4) Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets with `random_state=42`. 5) Train the following three classifiers on the training data: Logistic Regression (default parameters), Support Vector Machine (SVC with a linear kernel and `random_state=42`), and Random Forest Classifier (`n_estimators=100`, `random_state=42`). 6) For each classifier, predict on the test set and report accuracy, precision (macro average), recall (macro average), and F1-score (macro average). 7) Print which model performed best based on the highest F1-score (macro average). Include proper imports (pandas, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.svm, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.metrics) and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",

  "evaluation_criteria": "Code should correctly load data, preprocess features (`SepalLengthCm`, `SepalWidthCm`, `PetalLengthCm`, `PetalWidthCm`) and target (`Species`), split data (80/20, random_state=42), train Logistic Regression, SVC (linear kernel), and Random Forest models. It must evaluate each using accuracy, macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-score, and identify the best model by F1-score."
