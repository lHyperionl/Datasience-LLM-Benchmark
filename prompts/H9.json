  "prompt": "Write Python code to perform comprehensive water quality clustering and segmentation analysis on the water_potability.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Engineer advanced features including water quality indices, chemical balance ratios, contamination risk scores, and temporal patterns if applicable, 2) Apply multiple clustering algorithms (K-means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models, Spectral Clustering) with proper preprocessing and scaling, 3) Determine optimal number of clusters using multiple validation techniques (silhouette analysis, gap statistic, elbow method, Davies-Bouldin index, Calinski-Harabasz index), 4) Implement dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, Factor Analysis) for visualization and clustering enhancement, 5) Perform cluster stability analysis using bootstrap resampling and consensus clustering, 6) Analyze water quality profiles for each cluster including chemical composition patterns, contamination risks, and potability rates, 7) Create comprehensive cluster visualization dashboard with 2D/3D plots, radar charts for cluster profiles, and interactive visualizations, 8) Validate clustering results using external criteria and domain knowledge about water quality standards, 9) Implement cluster-based anomaly detection to identify unusual water samples. Include proper imports (pandas, sklearn, umap, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, numpy) and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
