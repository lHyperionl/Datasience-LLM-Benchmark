  "prompt": "Write Python code to perform feature engineering on the spotify_2023.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Load the dataset. 2) Combine `released_year`, `released_month`, and `released_day` into a single datetime column named `release_date`. Handle potential errors during conversion by setting invalid dates to NaT. 3) Create a new feature named `days_since_release`, calculated as the number of days between `release_date` and a fixed date '2023-12-31'. This new feature should be an integer. 4) Display the `track_name`, `release_date`, and `days_since_release` for the first 5 tracks. Include proper imports (pandas) and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
