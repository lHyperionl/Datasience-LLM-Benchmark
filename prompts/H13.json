  "prompt": "Write Python code to implement advanced ensemble learning and model optimization for diabetes prediction using the diabetes.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Load and preprocess the dataset with comprehensive feature engineering, 2) Implement advanced ensemble methods: Voting Classifier (soft and hard voting), Bagging with different base estimators, Boosting algorithms (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM), 3) Create a stacking ensemble with multiple base learners and a meta-learner, 4) Implement Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning using libraries like Optuna or Hyperopt, 5) Use nested cross-validation for unbiased model evaluation, 6) Implement custom ensemble methods with dynamic weight assignment, 7) Apply advanced techniques like CatBoost for handling categorical features, 8) Perform comprehensive model interpretation using SHAP values, 9) Implement model calibration and reliability analysis, 10) Create ensemble diversity analysis and model combination strategies. Include proper imports and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
