  "prompt": "Write Python code to perform advanced statistical modeling and causal inference on the world-happiness-report-2021.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Load and preprocess the dataset with comprehensive missing value handling, 2) Implement hierarchical Bayesian models using PyMC3 or PyMC4 to model happiness with regional random effects, 3) Build structural equation models (SEM) to analyze causal pathways between economic, social, and psychological factors, 4) Perform causal inference using instrumental variables and propensity score matching to identify causal effects of GDP on happiness, 5) Implement Bayesian regression with informative priors based on happiness research literature, 6) Use Gaussian processes for non-parametric modeling of complex relationships, 7) Apply mediation analysis to understand how social factors mediate the GDP-happiness relationship, 8) Implement difference-in-differences analysis (simulate time component) for policy impact assessment, 9) Perform Bayesian model comparison using WAIC, LOO-CV, and Bayes factors, 10) Create credible intervals, posterior predictive checks, and sensitivity analysis for robust inference. Include proper imports and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
