  "prompt": "Write Python code to perform advanced clustering and country segmentation analysis on the world-happiness-report-2021.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Load and preprocess the dataset with advanced feature engineering including happiness profiles and regional characteristics, 2) Implement multiple clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, Spectral Clustering, and HDBSCAN, 3) Use advanced dimensionality reduction techniques: t-SNE, UMAP, autoencoders, and manifold learning for visualization, 4) Determine optimal clustering parameters using silhouette analysis, gap statistic, elbow method, and stability analysis, 5) Perform consensus clustering to identify robust country groupings across different algorithms, 6) Create detailed country profiles for each cluster with statistical significance testing and effect size analysis, 7) Implement anomaly detection to identify countries with unusual happiness patterns, 8) Apply network analysis to understand relationships between countries based on happiness factors, 9) Use association rule mining to discover patterns in happiness characteristics, 10) Build a country recommendation system and policy insights based on clustering results with geopolitical validation. Include proper imports and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
