  "prompt": "Write Python code to perform advanced statistical modeling and anomaly detection for water quality analysis on the water_potability.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Implement multiple missing data imputation techniques (MICE, KNN, iterative imputer) and compare their effectiveness, 2) Build multivariate statistical models including logistic regression with regularization, GAM (Generalized Additive Models), and Bayesian logistic regression using PyMC3, 3) Perform advanced hypothesis testing including multivariate ANOVA, permutation tests, and bootstrap confidence intervals, 4) Implement anomaly detection algorithms (Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, One-Class SVM) to identify unusual water quality patterns, 5) Conduct principal component analysis and factor analysis to understand underlying data structure, 6) Apply robust statistical methods to handle outliers and non-normal distributions, 7) Perform model diagnostics including residual analysis, influence measures, and goodness-of-fit tests, 8) Create advanced statistical visualizations including Q-Q plots, leverage plots, and diagnostic dashboards. Include proper imports (pandas, statsmodels, pymc3, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy) and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
