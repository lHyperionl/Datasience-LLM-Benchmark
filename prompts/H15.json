  "prompt": "Write Python code to perform advanced clustering and patient segmentation analysis on the diabetes.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Load and preprocess the dataset with advanced feature engineering including metabolic syndrome indicators, 2) Implement multiple clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, Spectral Clustering, and OPTICS, 3) Use advanced dimensionality reduction techniques: t-SNE, UMAP, and Autoencoder-based embeddings for visualization, 4) Determine optimal clustering parameters using silhouette analysis, gap statistic, and elbow method with statistical validation, 5) Perform consensus clustering to identify stable patient subgroups across different algorithms, 6) Create detailed patient phenotype profiles for each cluster with statistical significance testing, 7) Implement anomaly detection to identify unusual patient profiles or outliers, 8) Apply time-series clustering if temporal patterns exist in the data, 9) Use association rule mining to discover patterns between patient characteristics and diabetes risk factors, 10) Build a patient risk stratification system based on clustering results with clinical interpretation. Include proper imports and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
