  "prompt": "Write Python code to perform K-Means clustering on selected numerical features from the heart.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Load the dataset. 2) Select the following numerical features for clustering: `Age`, `RestingBP`, `Cholesterol`, `MaxHR`, and `Oldpeak`. 3) Standardize these selected features using StandardScaler. 4) Determine an appropriate number of clusters (K) for K-Means, trying values for K from 2 to 5. Use the elbow method (plotting Within-Cluster Sum of Squares - WCSS) and silhouette scores to justify your choice of K. 5) Apply K-Means clustering with the chosen K, using `n_init='auto'` and `random_state=42`. 6) Reduce the dimensionality of the standardized features to 2 components using PCA. 7) Create a scatter plot of the two principal components, coloring the points by their assigned K-Means cluster labels. Add a title to this plot. Include proper imports (pandas, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.cluster, sklearn.decomposition, matplotlib.pyplot) and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
