  "prompt": "Write Python code to load the mobiles_2025.csv dataset using pandas. The code should: 1) Clean the `Launched Price (India)` column by removing 'INR ', removing commas, and converting to numeric. Handle any conversion errors by setting to NaN. 2) Clean the `RAM` column by removing 'GB' and converting to numeric, handling errors by setting to NaN. 3) Filter the dataset to include only rows where `Company Name` is 'Apple' and the cleaned `Launched Price (India)` is less than 100,000. 4) From this filtered dataset, select and display the `Model Name`, cleaned `RAM`, and cleaned `Launched Price (India)` columns. 5) Sort the resulting data by the cleaned `Launched Price (India)` in ascending order. Include proper imports and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
