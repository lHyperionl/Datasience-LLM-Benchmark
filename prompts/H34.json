  "prompt": "Write Python code to build a regression model to predict video likes on the youtube_trendings.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Load the dataset. 2) For `Likes`, `Dislikes`, and `Video views`: remove commas, convert to numeric, and fill resulting NaNs with 0. 3) Treat the `published` column (year) as a numeric feature. 4) For the `Category` column: fill missing values with 'Unknown', then apply one-hot encoding. 5) Define features `X` using cleaned `Dislikes`, cleaned `Video views`, the `published` year, and the one-hot encoded `Category` columns. The target `y` is the cleaned `Likes` column. 6) Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `random_state=42`. 7) Train a Linear Regression model on the training data. 8) Evaluate the model on the test set and report the R-squared (R2) score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Include proper imports (pandas, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.preprocessing) and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",

Fill missing `Category` with 'Unknown' and one-hot encode it. Predict cleaned `Likes` using cleaned `Dislikes`, cleaned `Video views`, `published` year, and OHE `Category`. Split 80/20 (random_state=42). Train Linear Regression, report R2 and MAE on test set."
