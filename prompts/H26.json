  "prompt": "Write Python code to perform K-Means clustering and PCA on the iris.csv dataset. The code should: 1) Load the dataset. 2) Select the features `SepalLengthCm`, `SepalWidthCm`, `PetalLengthCm`, and `PetalWidthCm`. 3) Standardize these features using StandardScaler. 4) Apply K-Means clustering to the standardized features, assuming K=3 (to match the number of species). Use `n_init='auto'` and `random_state=42` for K-Means. 5) Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the standardized features to 2 principal components. 6) Create a scatter plot of the two principal components, coloring the points by their K-Means assigned cluster labels. Add a title to this plot. 7) Create a second scatter plot of the two principal components, this time coloring the points by the true `Species` labels (after encoding `Species` to numerical values for coloring). Add a title to this plot for comparison. Include proper imports (pandas, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.cluster, sklearn.decomposition, matplotlib.pyplot) and assume the CSV file is in the current directory. Provide only the Python code without explanations.",
